# HONKY ROADS
A simple 2D bomber shooter game built using PixiJS to raise awareness against sound pollution in cities due to unwanted honking.

## Description
Welcome to Honky Roads, a game where you must strive to put a stop to honking in cities by busting honking vehicles. Your mission is to drop bombs on the honking vehicles.
As you play you will meet alien ufos who are invading earth. They are attracted here by the sound pollution on earth.
They are also corrupting humans into some crazy honkers who will try to stop you. Along with that, you will meet bosses whom you must put an end to.
The game has infinite levels so it gets harder as you play.
Strive to get a high score.
